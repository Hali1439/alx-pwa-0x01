# ProWeb Pulse: Mastering PWA Fundamentals

## 📌 Project Overview
This project transforms the **Cine Seek movie application** into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** using **Next.js** and the **next-pwa** package. The implementation adds offline support, installability, and performance optimizations with service workers, while maintaining the app’s core movie browsing features.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand PWA fundamentals and their benefits.  
- Implement **service workers** in a Next.js application.  
- Configure **web app manifests** for mobile installability.  
- Set up **caching strategies** for offline use.  
- Deploy and test PWA functionality in production.  

## 🧩 Key Concepts
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** – Web apps with native-like experiences.  
- **Service Workers** – Scripts that enable offline access and caching.  
- **Web App Manifest** – Metadata for installable web apps.  
- **Cache Strategies** – Efficiently store assets for speed and offline usage.  
- **Install Prompt** – Let users add the app to their home screen.  

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React framework  
- [@ducanh2912/next-pwa](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa) – PWA plugin  
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) – Module bundler  
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) – Deployment platform  
- [PWA Manifest Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator) – Generate icons/manifests  

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case
The Cine Seek PWA shows how streaming and media apps benefit from PWA features:  
- **Offline Access** – View cached movie details without internet.  
- **Improved Performance** – Faster loading from cached assets.  
- **Installability** – Add Cine Seek directly to your mobile home screen.  
- **Cross-Platform** – Works across devices with a single codebase.  
- **Discoverability** – Can appear in app stores and search results.  

This strategy is used by **Netflix, Disney+, and Spotify Lite** to deliver app-like experiences without requiring app store downloads.
